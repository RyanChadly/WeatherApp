# WeatherApp
This is a react Native app that lets choose from which city you can get the current weather.
You can keep a list of favorite cities, they will be stored in asynchronous storage.
This was only tested on IOS with Xcode emulator or on an iphone by scanning qr code ( I am using Expo )


After cloning repository you can run **yarn** to install 

To run : **yarn run ios**

For unit tests : **yarn test**



It might also work on android : **yarn run android**

and on web: **yarn run web**
